## Problem

Traditional dispute resolution and argument evaluation systems are:
- Centralized and prone to bias
- Lack transparency in decision-making
- Time-consuming and expensive
- Not easily accessible to everyone


## Solution
- Autonomous and verifiable argument evaluation through Eigenlayer AVS
- Utilizes [Opacity](https://www.opacity.network/) for off-chain AI powered decision making
- Integratable with any platform

## Impact
Many platforms are simply overwhelmed by the number of bots and with recent monetization programs becoming popular (ie X) creators have resorted to prioritizing content that drives clicks, rather than crafting the highest quality posts. By using AI to analyze content, platforms can effeciently eliminate or demonitize content that doesn't meet criteria. Incorporating the AVS allows for transparency. Any user can view the prompt that was used to analyze the content. This ensures that platforms are not injecting their own biases into the filtering.
